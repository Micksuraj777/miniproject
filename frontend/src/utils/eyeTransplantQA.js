  // General Questions
  "what is eye tissue transplantation": {
    answer: "Eye tissue transplantation is a surgical procedure where damaged or diseased corneal tissue is replaced with healthy donor tissue. This procedure helps restore vision and reduce pain in patients with corneal problems. The most common type is corneal transplantation, which can be either full-thickness or partial-thickness depending on the patient's condition.",
    category: "general"
  },
  "what are the different types of corneal transplants": {
    answer: "There are several types of corneal transplants: 1) Penetrating Keratoplasty (PKP) - full-thickness transplant 2) DMEK (Descemet's Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty) - inner layer replacement 3) DSAEK (Descemet's Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty) - partial thickness 4) ALK (Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty) - outer layer replacement. The choice depends on which layers of the cornea are damaged.",
    category: "general"
  },
  "how long does the surgery take": {
    answer: "A typical corneal transplant surgery takes between 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the specific technique used and complexity of the case. The procedure is usually performed under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis.",
    category: "procedure"
  },

  // Donor-related Questions
  "who can donate eye tissue": {
    answer: "Most people can donate their corneas. Unlike other organ donations, age, eye color, or quality of vision don't matter. However, donors with certain infectious diseases or conditions like HIV, hepatitis, or active cancer may not be eligible. The corneas must be harvested within 12 hours of death and can be stored for up to 14 days.",
    category: "donor"
  },
  "how are donor tissues screened": {
    answer: "Donor tissues undergo rigorous screening processes including: 1) Medical history review 2) Blood tests for infectious diseases 3) Physical examination of the tissue 4) Evaluation of tissue quality and viability. This ensures the safety and suitability of the tissue for transplantation.",
    category: "donor"
  },
  "how long can eye tissue be preserved": {
    answer: "Eye tissue (corneas) can be preserved for up to 14 days after harvesting when stored properly in specialized preservation medium at 4Â°C. However, most transplants are performed within 5-7 days of preservation for optimal results. The tissue bank regularly evaluates the quality of stored corneas through endothelial cell counts and other metrics.",
    category: "donor"
  },
  "what is tissue matching in eye transplant": {
    answer: "Unlike other organ transplants, tissue matching for corneal transplants doesn't require exact blood type or HLA matching. However, doctors consider: 1) Size of the donor cornea 2) Quality of the endothelial cells 3) Overall health of the tissue 4) Age of the donor tissue. This flexibility makes corneal transplants more readily available than other organ transplants.",
    category: "donor"
  },

  // Recipient Questions
  "who needs eye tissue transplant": {
    answer: "Eye tissue transplants are typically needed by patients with: 1) Corneal scarring from injury or infection 2) Keratoconus (thinning/bulging cornea) 3) Fuchs' dystrophy 4) Failed previous transplants 5) Severe corneal ulcers. The specific condition determines the type of transplant procedure required.",
    category: "recipient"
  },
  "what are the success rates": {
    answer: "Corneal transplant success rates are generally high: 90% of transplants remain clear after 1 year, and about 75% after 5 years. Success rates vary based on the underlying condition, type of procedure, and post-operative care. Regular follow-up and medication compliance are crucial for long-term success.",
    category: "statistics"
  },
  "what conditions disqualify someone from receiving a transplant": {
    answer: "Factors that might disqualify someone from receiving a corneal transplant include: 1) Active eye infection 2) Severe dry eye syndrome 3) Uncontrolled glaucoma 4) Retinal or optic nerve damage 5) Inability to follow post-operative care 6) Certain autoimmune conditions. Each case is evaluated individually by the surgical team.",
    category: "recipient"
  },
  "how long is the waiting list": {
    answer: "Unlike other organ transplants, the waiting time for corneal transplants is relatively short, usually between 2-4 weeks in most developed countries. This is because: 1) Tissue matching is less strict 2) More people can donate corneas 3) Tissues can be preserved longer 4) There's a good donation rate for corneas.",
